				<h1><strong>Jobs</strong></h1>
				<p>A job is any position in which a worker provides labor in exchange for monetary compensation.</p>
				<p>This includes those who work as employees for businesses (a.k.a. “wage and salary” employees) and proprietors who work for themselves.</p>
				<p>Lightcast reports employment as annual averages.</p>
				<p>The exception is the Extended Proprietors Class of Worker (Class 4), which counts proprietors that existed at any time during a given year, because those data are based on tax returns.</p>
				<p>Employment averages represent jobs, not workers, since one individual may hold multiple jobs.</p>
				<p>Due to limitations of source data, both full- and part-time jobs are included and counted equally, i.e. job counts are not adjusted to full-time equivalents.</p>
				<p>Geographically, payroll jobs are always reported by the place of work rather than the worker’s place of residence. Conversely, self-employed and extended proprietors are always reported by their place of residence.</p> 
				<p>Unpaid family workers and volunteers are excluded from all Lightcast data.</p>
			
				<h1><strong>Location Quotient</strong></h1>
				<p>Location quotient (LQ) is a way of quantifying how concentrated a particular industry, cluster, occupation, or demographic group is in a region as compared to the nation.</p>
				<p>It can reveal what makes a particular region “unique.”</p>
				<p>For example, if the leather products manufacturing industry accounts for 10% of jobs in your area but 1% of jobs nationally, then the area’s leather-producing industry has an LQ of 10.</p>
				<p>So in your area, leather manufacturing accounts for a larger than average “share” of total jobs—the share is ten times larger than normal.</p>
				
				<h1><strong>Business Units</strong></h1>
				<p>A business unit is a single physical location of some type of economic activity (a business), used for reporting purposes in government data sources.</p>
				<p>A single company may have multiple business units.</p>
				<p>As an example, a single company with its corporate office in New York, a paper manufacturing plant in Georgia, and fifteen warehouses in various cities would comprise a total of seventeen business units, and each business units would be classified according to its own type of activity.</p> 
				<p>In this case, three different industries would be used: Corporate, subsidiary, and regional managing offices, Paper (except newsprint) mills, and General warehousing and storage.</p>
								
				<h1><strong>Average Wage per Job</strong></h1>
				<p>The average wage per job is the result of total pre-tax industry earnings divided by same-year industry employment.</p>
				<p>Wages are defined as labor-related personal income—that is, income from work.</p>
				<p>Income from stock dividends or interest, rents, and other non-work sources are not included.</p>
				<p>The average wage is the sum of wages and salaries, and supplements.</p>
				
				<h1><strong>GVA</strong></h1>
				<p>Gross value added (GVA) is an economic productivity metric that measures the contribution of a corporate subsidiary, company, or municipality to an economy, producer, sector, or region.</p>
				<p>GVA provides a dollar value for the amount of goods and services that have been produced in a country, minus the cost of all inputs and raw materials that are directly attributable to that production.</p> 
				<p>GVA thus adjusts gross domestic product (GDP) by the impact of subsidies and taxes (tariffs) on products.</p>
