# Information Visualisation Coursework

During my MSc in Data Science at UEA, I produced and presented an interactive data visualisation tool that detailed headline industry statistics for Norfolk & Suffolk, which was designed to be used by my employer (New Anglia LEP).

I achieved 98%, which is the highest mark ever awarded on the Information Visualisation module.
